## this second chapter on Django For Beginners

1. I have learnt about templates.
1. Extending templates using **extends method**, which is cool.
1. Testing django using SIMPLETESTCASE - because the app has no database yet.
1. Using **_class-based generic views_** that
make it easy to use and also extend views covering common use cases.
